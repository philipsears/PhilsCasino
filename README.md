# PhilsCasino
DOS-based Casino game (QB64)

## Background 
Phil's Casino was written by Philip Sears in high school as a fun project in the 90s.  It is a simple graphical DOS game that implements a Black Jack game, a Slot Machine, and a Pick-3 Lottery. 

## Requirements
Since it was written in QBasic you likley will need QB64 in order to build and run the game.

## Configure
I used for loops to create the delays and timing, originally on a very slow machine. In order to adjust the animation you will need to increase or decrease the delay variable.  I encourage anyone to fix this problem but I'm keeping to the spirit of my teenage solution.
